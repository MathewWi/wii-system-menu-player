some of the stuff that isnt done

* window class isnt done
	the tooltip (baloon.ash), homemenu (batteries), shadow for dialogs (dlgWdw.ash) depend on it getting done

* the text looks grainy and has some artifacts especially when scaled small

* complete lack of brsar sounds. :(

* all the data management screens are using 4:3.  they look bad using 16:9.  i think it has something to do with the missing
	stuff from the Window class still

* some parts of the settings/data management are not done
	settings - requires RSO crap
	gamecube data management - theres 6 layouts and 80 animation files to sift through.  far too much for something ill never use anyways

* im thinking that the bounding panes are used for button hot-spots, not using hardcoded numbers.  we can probably change to using those
